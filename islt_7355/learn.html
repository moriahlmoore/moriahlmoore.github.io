            <p id="symbols">
                Symbolism is a popular way of communicating specific information about the deceased. The reading of these symbols is now less-common 
                knowledge but knowing what some of the most common symbols means can deepen your visits to the cemetery and tell you more about the 
                people whose lives these stones mark. Symbols vary across time, place, and cultural context and some symbols which mean one thing in 
                a certain place and time will mean something entirely different elsewhere, for example the Buddist swastika and the Nazi hooked cross. 
                In a time when literacy was less common than it is today, the images carved into a stone were as important as the letters in the case 
                of visitor recognition and interpretation.

            <h3 id="howidentify">How to recognize and identify graves not marked by a modern western-style gravestone.</h3>
            <p id="identifying">
                If you are in a non-urban area that has been settled for a long time it is entirely possible that there are burial places outside 
                of sanctioned cemeteries, from graveyards of the enslaved to family cemeteries on family land. Oral tradition is often more correct 
                than the highly-educated like to admit. If locals say that there is an old cemetery no-longer marked in a certain place, then it is 
                very likely there. Certain signs can help to differentiate a graveyard from an ordinary plot of land, such as indentations in the earth 
                and the growth of certain plants, particularly yucca.

            <h3 id="howmaintenance">How to perform basic gravesite conservation for carved gravestones</h3>
            <p id="maintenance">
                A gravestone left uncleaned will deteriorate faster than one that is tended to about once every 7 to 10 years, however many cemeteries do not 
                include this kind of maintenance as a matter of course, particularly older cemeteries. If you would like to perform this task for a family member's 
                grave or even a stranger's it is often welcome. No matter whose stone you are considering cleaning, the first step when considering cleaning a carved gravestone is to gain permission from the gravesiteâ€™s proprietors, such as the church government, cemetery office, or family of the deceased in the case of a family plot.
                Before beginning, please note that gravestones in truly bad shape should be left to professionals. Do not try to restore broken or tipped stones
                 to their place and do not try to clean badly chipped stones. 
                No matter what condition the stone is in or what permission has been gained or not, it is always a safe and helpful choice to clear 
                and detritus around the base of and on the top of any stone in a public cemetery.
