    A little about me...
</h3>
<p>
    My name is Moriah and I am an archivist and librarian in a local history collection on Long Island, New York actively pursuing a Masters Degree in Library and Information Sciences. As a long time taphophile, I indulge my interest in graves and grave recordings with frequent visits to cemeteries from the small and close at hand to the massive and famous. Some of my favorite cemeteries I have visited are 
    <br>Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, NY
    <br>Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France 
    <br>Highgate Cemetery in London, England
    <br>Woodlawn Cemetery in Bronx, NY
    <br>The cemetery at San Miniato Al Monte in Florence, Italy
    <br>The Granary Burying Ground in Boston, MA
    <br>And the Jewish Cemetery on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, Israel
In addition to the <em>library</em> with which I currently work, I have also worked in an archival role at an academic library and as a researcher and the interim archivist at the Shelter Island Historical Society.
